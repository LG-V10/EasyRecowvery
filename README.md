## Tips:
- If you're having ADB problems, try dragging "adb.exe", "AdbWinApi.dll", and "AdbWinUsbApi.dll" into the folder with EasyRecowvery.
- You may want to Run as Administrator to avoid permission errors.
- Please provide your log files and/or screenshots when reporting issues.

## Todo & Known Issues
Host script can't tell if the flash failed. A check for this is under development.
If ADB crashes or restarts during the process, the host script may fail to complete.
Some of the latest changes and additions have sloppy output or logging.
TODO: Remember more of the things.
